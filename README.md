# News Scraper

I was wondering how much articles about "Artificial Intelligence" where published in the last few years. So I wrote this scraper to extract some data from [heise.de](https://www.heise.de), [golem.de](https://www.golem.de) and [spiegel-online.de](http://www.spiegel.de).

## Dependencies

Add the following packages to Julia
```Julia
julia> Pkg.add("Cascadia")
julia> Pkg.add("PlotlyJS")
```

## Run the scrapers
The Have a look at the `main.jl` file. There you can see how to run the different scrapers.

I recommend using the [Juno IDE](http://junolab.org) to run the code (or add some packages to your [Atom](https://atom.io): see [uber-juno](https://github.com/JunoLab/uber-juno)). Otherwise the plotting might not work.

> You can evaluate your Julia code inline by navigating your cursor to the appropriate code and hitting `Ctrl+Enter`. This will run the code block that the cursor is contained in. [...] To specifically choose which code to evaluate, highlight the appropriate parts and use `Ctrl+Enter`.

-> see [Juno Documentation](http://docs.junolab.org/latest/man/basic_usage.html)

## Results
Each of the three scraped websites provide a category with all articles about artificial intelligence. These articles are counted. You can see the results below.

It seems that we get nearly the same amout of articles like the year before (2017)...
